# Wikipedia Philosophy links

This is an experiment to check the "Everything links to philosophy" claim:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Getting_to_Philosophy

*TLDR* the algorithm works like this:
1. Clicking on the first non-parenthesized, non-italicized link
2. Ignoring external links, links to the current page, or red links (links to non-existent pages)
3. Stopping when reaching "Philosophy", a page with no links or a page that does not exist, or when a loop occurs
